Shuffles mp3 files by renaming files. Use case: My car stereo can read MP3 files from an SD card, but lacks the much-needed shuffle feature. I use this app to shuffle music from my SD card.

TODO 1 provide chosen directory to shuffle via a directory picker
TODO 2 save changes in a log file for revert
